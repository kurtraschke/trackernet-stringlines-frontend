# How To Use

This is not meant to serve as a comprehensive course in service analysis using stringline diagrams, but rather to orient
the user to certain features of this site.

Upon loading, the [stringlines](/stringline) page will show a pre-selected chart configuration for the current traffic day. (Note that the London Underground traffic day runs from 03:00:00 local time to 02:59:59 the following morning, and this tool follows that convention.)

Other chart configurations and traffic days can be selected with the controls above the chart area. As data quality from the Trackernet API is not uniform, a data quality indicator is provided to advise the user of caveats related to the data for particular chart configurations. Hover over the data quality indicator for additional details.

It is possible to zoom in to the chart by using a scroll wheel, two-finger scrolling, or pinching; click or tap and drag to move the chart area. Double-click or tap on the chart area to reset to the default view.

Hovering over a single trip will highlight that trip and other trips operated by the same set; hovering over a point (representing a single station stop on a single trip) will show a tooltip with additional data about that point.

Charts can be exported as SVG or JPEG by using the menu at the far right.
